Simple scripts to use Bup over Samba

# Purposes

I personaly use these scripts to backup my files to a hard disk drive plugged into my Internet box (Livebox).

# How to use

From a terminal:
* Make a backup: `bin/backup.sh`
* Show backups: `bin/fuse.sh`

Launchers are available in `apps/`

# Configuration

All config is stored in `bin/mount.sh`.
